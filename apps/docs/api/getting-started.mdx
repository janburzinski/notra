## Quick Start

Run your first authenticated API request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.usenotra.com/v1/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID/posts/"
```

<Tip>
  Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key and `YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID` with your
  organization ID.
</Tip>

Create and manage API keys in [Authentication](/api/authentication).

<Warning>
  Keep API keys private. Even read-only keys can be abused and burn through your
  [rate limits](/api/rate-limits) if exposed in client-side code. Use server-side
  requests whenever possible.
</Warning>
