Notra API requests are authenticated with API keys.

## How It Works

Include your key in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.usenotra.com/v1/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID/posts/"
```

```typescript TypeScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.usenotra.com/v1/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID/posts/",
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.NOTRA_API_KEY}`,
    },
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Create an API Key

1. Open your workspace dashboard.
2. Go to **API Keys** under **Developer**.
3. Click **Create API Key**.
4. Choose a name, permission, and optional expiration.
5. Copy the key and store it securely.

API keys are powered by [Unkey](https://unkey.dev).

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Treat API keys as secrets. Do not expose them in client-side code, public
  repositories, or logs.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Store your key in a server-side environment variable such as `NOTRA_API_KEY`
  and make requests from your backend whenever possible.
</Tip>

If a key is exposed, rotate it immediately in **Settings > API Keys**.
