description: "Welcome to the Notra API."

<Warning>
  The API and these docs are a work in progress. Endpoints and response shapes
  may change as we keep improving Notra.
</Warning>

The Notra API follows standard REST conventions. Endpoints are resource-based,
responses are JSON, and HTTP status codes indicate success or failure.

## Base URL

All API access is over HTTPS. All data is sent and received as JSON.

```
https://api.usenotra.com/v1/:organizationId/:resource
```

Where `:organizationId` is your organization ID and `:resource` is the specific
resource you want to interact with (e.g., `posts`, `categories`, `tags`,
`authors`).

## Authentication

Notra uses API keys for authentication. You can create and manage keys in your
workspace dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**.

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request using the
`Bearer` scheme:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.usenotra.com/v1/YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID/posts/"
```

<Warning>
  While public API keys currently only provide read-only access, they should
  still be handled with care. Exposing your key in client-side code allows
  anyone to make requests on your behalf, which can lead to your [rate
  limits](/api/rate-limits) being exhausted. We recommend using keys on the
  server-side whenever possible.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  **Best Practice:** Keep API calls on the server-side whenever possible to
  avoid exposing your API key.

## Response Format

All responses are JSON. Success responses return data. Error responses return an
`error` field.

<Note>All timestamps are in UTC ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`</Note>

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Code  | Description                               |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `200` | Success                                   |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters          |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist        |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded   |
| `500` | Internal Server Error                     |

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized"
}
```
