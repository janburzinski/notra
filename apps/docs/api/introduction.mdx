<Warning>
  The API and these docs are a work in progress. Endpoints and response shapes
  may change as we keep improving Notra.
</Warning>

The Notra API follows standard REST conventions. Endpoints are resource-based,
responses are JSON, and HTTP status codes indicate success or failure.

## Base URL

All API access is over HTTPS. All data is sent and received as JSON.

```bash
https://api.usenotra.com/v1/:organizationId/:resource
```

Where `:organizationId` is your organization ID and `:resource` is the specific
resource you want to interact with (e.g., `posts`, `categories`, `tags`,
`authors`).

## Response Format

All responses are JSON. Successful responses return data objects. Error responses
return an `error` field.

<Note>All timestamps are in UTC ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`</Note>

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Code  | Description                               |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `200` | Success                                   |
| `400` | Bad Request - Invalid parameters          |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| `404` | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist        |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded   |
| `500` | Internal Server Error                     |
