# AI traffic ingestion

Hono HTTP service on Bun for `POST /api/geo/ingest`, hosted on Unkey Compute.
Hono handles routing and HTTP responses. The Effect processing pipeline lives
in `packages/geo-core/src/ingest` and is also used by the dashboard's
compatibility handler. `Effect.runPromise` is the boundary between Hono and
the pipeline; typed failures are mapped to HTTP responses via `Effect.result`.

## Responsibilities

- This service verifies tracking tokens, classifies visitors, checks project
  hosts and token revocation, applies the existing Redis rate limit, resolves
  journeys, and writes tracked events to Tinybird.
- The dashboard still owns projects, settings, token issuance and rotation,
  installation snippets, and traffic queries.
- Both use the same Postgres, Redis, Tinybird workspace and signing secret.
  Shared Redis keys preserve cache invalidation and the per-organization limit
  across replicas.

Tracked events receive `202` once queued in the bounded in-memory batcher, or
after Tinybird accepts a direct write when the batcher is full. Dropped
traffic also receives `202`. The batcher retries transient write failures; queued
events are not durable across a forced process exit. Analytics run in the
background. Billable events are summed per organization and reported to Autumn
every 5 seconds, not one request per event. A sum Autumn answers with 429 or
503 is retried at the next report; other failures may have been recorded, so
they are logged with their event count instead of retried. SIGTERM stops accepting requests and
waits for active requests, background work, the batchers and the pending usage
report before closing the database pool and exiting.

Concurrent requests for the same token, project or organization share one
in-flight token-generation, host and site lookup. Nothing is kept once it
settles, so revocation and host changes still apply on the next lookup.
Rate-limit hits return `429`; Redis transport failures and limiter timeouts return
`502` without writing an event. Redis availability is required for tracked ingestion.
Token generation is still checked against Postgres and fails closed on an outage.
An identity lookup failure returns `502`; missing identities and revoked tokens
return `401`. Rejection logs retain `reason: invalid_token` and add `authReason`
to distinguish an invalid signature, missing identity, revoked token, inactive
site, or a site token used for a drain. Lookup failures include `stage` as
`identity_lookup` or `site_lookup`. Signed organization/project/site IDs are
included when available; raw tokens and scope from invalid signatures are never
logged.

Before identity and host lookups, tracked AI envelopes and malformed signed payloads
pass a separate 1,000-request-per-minute admission limit keyed by organization,
project and token generation. Token rotation gets a fresh admission budget, and
revoked tokens cannot consume the existing organization-wide accepted-traffic quota.
Human/unknown traffic keeps its zero-I/O drop path.

The worker disables pg's default 10-second idle connection eviction. Sparse AI
traffic therefore reuses connections instead of paying a new TLS/database
handshake after every idle gap. The existing pool maximum (10 connections per
replica), 10-second acquisition timeout and idle-client error handler are
unchanged. No keepalive queries run; a connection dropped by the database is
removed by pg and recreated on demand. Dashboard/API pool defaults are unchanged.

## Local development

From the repository root:

```sh
bun install
bun run dev --filter=ai-traffic-ingest
bun run --filter=ai-traffic-ingest test
bun run --filter=ai-traffic-ingest check-types
```

The root dev command loads the root `.env`. The default local port is `3101`.
See the environment table below for the service-specific variables.

## Unkey Compute configuration

Create a Compute app connected to `usenotra/notra`, branch `main`. This is
application hosting, not Unkey API-key management. Configure its production
environment manually; this repository does not provision it or change DNS.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Build root / context | `.` (repository root, not the app directory) |
| Dockerfile | `apps/ai-traffic-ingest/Dockerfile` |
| Container port | `3000` (`PORT=3000`) |
| Protocol | `http1` |
| Readiness probe | `GET /readyz` |
| Replicas | 2 in the same region, near the existing Postgres and Upstash |
| Start command | Keep the image CMD: `bun dist/index.js` |

Use the existing Dockerfile and its pinned Bun 1.4.4 image. It builds shared
workspace packages from the root and needs no build-time credentials or database
migration. Do not replace its CMD with a development server.

Set the required runtime variables below using the operator's secret-management
workflow. Never put them in build arguments, source, logs, or a deployment root
key. Unkey injects `UNKEY_DEPLOYMENT_ID`, `UNKEY_INSTANCE_ID`, and `UNKEY_REGION`;
do not invent or manually set these IDs. Runtime detection uses the deployment
ID and logs the injected region and instance ID when available.

Leave gateway authentication policies unset: ingestion bearer tokens are Notra
tracking tokens, not Unkey API keys. With no policy, the gateway is passthrough;
do not add an Unkey API-key policy. The gateway documentation specifies no body-size
cap; keep the service's existing per-route limits (including larger drain batches),
rather than adding a new gateway cap. Never log Authorization headers or request
bodies at the gateway or service.

### Termination prerequisite

Before sending production traffic, verify Unkey Compute's actual SIGTERM delivery
and termination grace for this app with an isolated test deployment. Shutdown
allows 35 seconds for active/background work, then stops the three independent
batchers and the usage report concurrently with a 12-second deadline each, then allows 2 seconds to
close Postgres and 10 seconds to flush logs: a nominal 59-second budget plus
runtime overhead. Confirm adequate host grace and test replacement/shutdown under load.
Deadlines do not make queued events durable; forced termination or failed writes
can lose buffered events. Do not cut over if the host's grace is inadequate.

### Safe local container checks

From the repository root, without a real `.env` or credentials:

```sh
docker build -f apps/ai-traffic-ingest/Dockerfile -t notra-ai-traffic-ingest .
docker run --rm -d --name notra-ingest-check -p 127.0.0.1:3101:3000 notra-ai-traffic-ingest
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:3101/healthz
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:3101/readyz
curl -i -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3101/api/geo/ingest
docker stop --time 70 notra-ingest-check
```

Expect liveness `200`, readiness `503`, and ingestion `503` with missing
configuration. The worker tests use synthetic localhost-only dependency URLs
to verify configured readiness and token rejection without contacting production.

## Set up a new Unkey Compute app

1. Create and **initially deploy the Unkey app manually**, before enabling
   scheduled domain discovery.
   A new app without a verified domain and current deployment cannot pass CI's
   preflight. Auto deploy may remain enabled during this setup.
2. First test a dedicated Unkey origin with isolated test Postgres, Redis,
   Tinybird, and a test signer/token. Verify `/healthz`, `/readyz`, real tracked
   requests, drain routes, rate limiting, Tinybird arrival, and telemetry. Test
   shutdown and the host-grace prerequisite above. Readiness alone is not proof
   that dependencies or credentials work. Do not use customer traffic as a test.
3. Have the operator set the existing shared production runtime configuration,
   including the exact dashboard signing secret. Add `ingest.usenotra.com` to
   the ingest app's production environment and follow Unkey's domain verification
   and DNS instructions. Switch the stable domain only after origin validation;
   check HTTPS, route forwarding, token handling, and ingestion after the switch.
4. Audit `GEO_INGEST_URL` in dashboard and public API environments. Prefer
   `https://ingest.usenotra.com`, not a provider-specific origin, and redeploy
   those apps if changed. Existing dashboard routes proxy to that configured
   origin. The SDK already defaults to `https://ingest.usenotra.com`, so moving
   that stable domain requires no customer configuration or token rotation.
   Explicit provider-specific client endpoints still need a separate audit.
5. After the initial deployment and domain verification, scheduled releases use
   the existing `UNKEY_DEPLOY_ROOT_KEY`
   repository secret used for API deployments; no second key secret is needed.
   Grant that key read access to all four Unkey apps, production environments, domains and
   deployments, plus deployment-create access for all targets. Runtime API-key
   management keys are unrelated; environment-variable read/write grants are not
   needed. Run **Production deploy** with `dry_run` checked. Only after a successful
   dry-run and when scheduled releases are ready, disable production **Auto deploy**
   for ingest, preserving the GitHub connection, and verify a manual real workflow
   run. No additional release flags are needed: the shared key enables API,
   ingest and both demo apps. A permission failure or other Unkey error fails
   the release. Without the shared key, ingest is not released.
   See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Manual Unkey deployments remain available if scheduled ingest releases are not
enabled. Do not disable the current deployment trigger before its replacement
is ready.

Removing `GEO_INGEST_URL` is a rollback: it restores the dashboard's
local compatibility handler but does not redirect SDK clients using the stable
ingest domain. Use the legacy fallback procedure below only when that is intended.

## Docker image

The Docker image contains only Bun and the built bundle. No Next.js server,
build-time credentials, or database migration is required. Build locally with:

```sh
docker build -f apps/ai-traffic-ingest/Dockerfile -t notra-ai-traffic-ingest .
```

## Environment variables

For production, copy these values from the existing dashboard configuration into
the service. Use isolated equivalents for origin testing, never production data:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Existing Notra Postgres database |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | Existing Redis endpoint |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Existing Redis credentials |
| `TINYBIRD_TOKEN` | Existing token with ingestion permissions |
| `GEO_INGEST_SECRET` | The exact signing secret used by the dashboard |
| `AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY` | Existing billing key; meters and limits `ai_traffic_events`. Without it, events are accepted unmetered and a warning is logged |
| `TINYBIRD_BASE_URL` | Optional existing Tinybird endpoint, especially for a non-default region |

`TINYBIRD_URL` remains a supported alias for the Tinybird base URL.
Optional telemetry variables are `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`, `AXIOM_TOKEN`, and `AXIOM_ORG_ID`. Logs go to the
`notra-geo-scan` dataset by default; set `AXIOM_GEO_DATASET` only to override it.
Set `PORT=3000` on the host to match the configured public target port.

Without required configuration, the process starts but rejects ingestion with
`503`. `GET /healthz` checks process liveness and returns `200`.
`GET /readyz` returns `503` until all required values are present, then `200`.
Readiness checks configuration only, not external connectivity or credential
validity. Check a real AI request and its appearance in the dashboard before
switching production traffic.

## Point the dashboard at the service

1. Add the shared credentials to the service, redeploy, and verify `/readyz`.
2. Send an AI request through a site with a valid project token and confirm
   that Tinybird and the dashboard receive it.
3. Set `GEO_INGEST_URL` to the service's public HTTPS origin in the dashboard
   and public API environments, then redeploy those apps.
4. New setup snippets point directly to the service. The dashboard uses Nitro
   `routeRules` proxies to forward existing `/api/geo/ingest` and drain
   installs to the service without invoking its local handler or asking
   customers to rotate tokens.

The SDK's default origin is `https://ingest.usenotra.com`. Verify that this host
serves `/api/geo/ingest` with the shared credentials before publishing an SDK
release that uses it. Self-hosted SDK installations must configure `endpoint`
explicitly; they do not inherit the dashboard's `GEO_INGEST_URL`.

Leave `GEO_INGEST_URL` unset until the service is ready. The existing dashboard
endpoint continues using the shared pipeline locally.

### Dashboard fallback (legacy)

1. Unset `GEO_INGEST_URL` and redeploy the dashboard and API. This restores the
   dashboard's local handler and makes newly generated snippets use its origin.
2. Sites using the SDK default or an explicit dedicated-service URL must set
   `endpoint: "https://app.usenotra.com"` and redeploy. Use the deployment's
   dashboard origin for self-hosted installations.
3. Verify a tracked request reaches Tinybird through the dashboard handler.

Removing `GEO_INGEST_URL` only changes dashboard routing and generated snippets.
It does not redirect requests sent to `ingest.usenotra.com` or another dedicated
origin. The SDK has no automatic dashboard fallback. Direct clients continue
using the dedicated service until their endpoint is changed and redeployed.

## Monitoring in Axiom

The standalone worker also emits `geo.ingest.runtime` once per minute with
process RSS, JS heap and external memory (bytes), active requests, background
tasks, buffered events, events not yet reported to Autumn
(`usageBufferedEvents`), and total/idle/waiting database connections. Use these
counters to distinguish retained process memory from growing queues; RSS alone
does not establish a JS memory leak. Unkey instance and deployment IDs separate
processes and restarts. These events contain no
request payloads.

```kusto
['notra-geo-scan'] | where event == 'geo.ingest.runtime'
| summarize rss = max(todouble(rssBytes)), heap = max(todouble(heapUsedBytes)),
    pending = max(todouble(pendingTasks)), buffered = max(todouble(bufferedEvents))
    by bin(_time, 1m), tostring(replicaId), tostring(deploymentId)
```

Every ingest request, on Unkey and the dashboard fallback, emits one
`geo.ingest` event to the `notra-geo-scan` dataset with `outcome`
(`ingested`, `dropped`, `rejected`, `failed`), `reason`, `status`,
`durationMs`, `ingestMs` (Tinybird write), `visitorType`, `source`, `agent`,
`organizationId`, `projectId`, `runtime` (`unkey`, `vercel`, `local`),
`region` and `weight`. Dropped human traffic is sampled at 5%, so always count
with `sum(weight)` instead of `count()`.

```kusto
// Requests per second
['notra-geo-scan'] | where event == 'geo.ingest'
| summarize rps = sum(todouble(weight)) / 60 by bin(_time, 1m), tostring(runtime)

// Ingested events per second, by AI source
['notra-geo-scan'] | where event == 'geo.ingest' and outcome == 'ingested'
| summarize eps = count() / 60.0 by bin(_time, 1m), tostring(source)

// Totals by outcome and reason
['notra-geo-scan'] | where event == 'geo.ingest'
| summarize requests = sum(todouble(weight)) by tostring(outcome), tostring(reason)

// Latency and Tinybird write time
['notra-geo-scan'] | where event == 'geo.ingest' and outcome == 'ingested'
| summarize p50 = percentile(durationMs, 50), p95 = percentile(durationMs, 95),
    p99 = percentile(durationMs, 99), tinybird_p95 = percentile(ingestMs, 95)
    by bin_auto(_time)

// Error rate and top failure messages
['notra-geo-scan'] | where event == 'geo.ingest' and outcome == 'failed'
| summarize failures = count() by tostring(reason), tostring(errorMessage)

// Top organizations by ingested events
['notra-geo-scan'] | where event == 'geo.ingest' and outcome == 'ingested'
| summarize events = count() by tostring(organizationId) | top 20 by events
```
