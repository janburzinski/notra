---

Over the past seven days, Better Auth delivered critical authentication and billing infrastructure updates, alongside enterprise identity management enhancements. The platform expanded Stripe integration capabilities, improved single sign-on robustness, and introduced comprehensive testing utilities. Eleven high-impact features and fixes were merged, strengthening support for modern billing strategies, federated identity verification, and multi-tenant SCIM workflows while addressing edge cases in rate limiting, email validation, and data type coercion.

## Highlights

### Seat-based and usage-based billing for Stripe

Flexible billing models now support per-seat subscription tiers and metered consumption tracking with configurable line items, letting B2B platforms monetize variable usage patterns alongside fixed-rate tiers. [#7930](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/7930)

### IdP-initiated SAML Single Logout (SLO) support

Identity providers can now initiate logout flows directly, broadening compatibility with enterprise federation workflows that require asymmetric SSO lifecycle management. [#7567](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/7567)

### SCIM ownership model and connection management

Multi-tenant identity synchronization now enforces explicit ownership, with dedicated endpoints for SCIM connection provisioning and lifecycle control—critical for regulated directory integrations. [#7931](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/7931)

### Test utilities plugin for integration and E2E testing

A new plugin streamlines auth flow testing with built-in helpers for simulating credentials, session management, and multi-user scenarios, reducing boilerplate in integration test suites. [#7746](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/7746)

### TXT record verification at subdomain level for SSO domain control

SSO domain verification now correctly resolves TXT records at the designated verification subdomain rather than root, preventing configuration conflicts in shared hosting environments. [#7935](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/pull/7935)
