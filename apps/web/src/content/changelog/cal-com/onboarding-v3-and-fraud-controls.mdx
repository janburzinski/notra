---

This week, Cal.com shipped major feature rollouts and infrastructure improvements. The onboarding v3 flow went live globally with new tests matched to the Plan Selection → Personal Settings → Calendar journey. Signup watchlist review locks new accounts flagged for fraud and automatically unlocks them when entries are deleted. Icon migration from the legacy Icon component to @coss/ui/icons reduced bundle size and improved maintainability. Active user billing and annual team plan options round out the billing toolkit. Reliability fixes addressed booking drawer overlaps, data-table imports, and companion app navigation, while security updates tightened the dependency stack.

## Highlights

### Signup watchlist review mode for fraud control

New feature flag locks and reviews flagged signups, preventing abuse while preserving account recovery on entry removal. Includes secure email verification ordering and prevents PII leakage in error logs.

### Onboarding v3 enabled globally with updated e2e tests

Rewritten onboarding (Plan Selection → Personal Settings → Calendar) is now the default. Updated e2e tests and signup flows accept both old and new paths to support smooth rollout.

### Icon component migration to @coss/ui/icons

Migrated 200+ static icon usages from `<Icon name="xxx" />` to `<XxxIcon />` components, improving bundle size and enabling better prop control. Supports legacy moduleResolution via typesVersions.

### Active user billing with annual team plans

New billing strategy supports both usage-based and seat pricing. Teams can buy annual subscriptions, and personal credits now act as fallback when team credits run out.

### Companion app configurable landing page

Users pick their app home (Bookings or Calendar), and the choice persists via local storage. Preferences clear on logout for a fresh start.
