---

This week brought substantial progress across evaluations, integrations, and infrastructure resilience. Single-span evaluations moved into open beta, critical fixes resolved persistent job queue deadlocks, and new filtering capabilities landed for the scores API. The team also modernized dashboard charting with Recharts and refined UI usability across multiple components.

## Highlights

### Single-span evaluations now in open beta

LLM-as-a-Judge can now target individual observations rather than full traces, making evaluation more granular and efficient at scale.

### Fixed integration queue deadlocks

Reverted a problematic hourly-key approach to job deduplication that caused Mixpanel and PostHog integration jobs to stall permanently. Static jobId handling is back, along with stalling protections to prevent future blocking.

### Advanced filtering for scores v2 API with metadata support

The scores v2 endpoint now supports advanced filters, unlocking metadata-based and observation-level filtering for more targeted score retrieval.

### Dashboard charting rebuilt with Recharts

Migrated home dashboards from Tremor to Recharts, gaining better legends, tooltips, and area time series support alongside improved visual consistency.

### Project-wide table defaults and always-visible playground controls

Table view defaults can now be set at project scope, and playground tool/schema buttons are always visible for better discoverability.
